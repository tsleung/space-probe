# MCS (Mars Colony Sim)

**Core Fantasy:** Governor of humanity's first permanent Martian settlement
**Tagline:** *"They came to explore. You're here to stay."*
**Inspiration:** The Expanse, Surviving Mars, RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, Frostpunk, Anno 1800

---

## Design Vision

### What Makes This Different

The base game asks: *"Can you survive Mars and return home?"*

Colony Sim asks: *"Can you build something that outlasts you?"*

This isn't Phase 3 extended—it's a fundamental shift in perspective. The original crew becomes the founders of something larger. Their children will walk under Martian skies. Their grandchildren will call Mars home.

### The Three Pillars

**1. Generational Stakes**
Your decisions echo through decades. That water recycler you built "good enough"? Your grandchildren curse your name when it fails in Year 47. That education program you invested in? It produces the engineer who saves the colony in Year 32.

**2. Emergent Society**
A colony isn't a base—it's people. Politics emerge. Factions form. A worker's strike at the wrong moment can kill more colonists than a dust storm. Love affairs produce unexpected children. A charismatic leader can unite or divide.

**3. The Long Goodbye**
Earth contact fades from central control to distant support to eventual independence. You're not just surviving—you're building the first human civilization that doesn't depend on Earth. The game ends when Earth is no longer necessary... or when it fails to save you.

## Campaign Structure

### Act 1: The Founders (Years 1-5)
**Core Fantasy:** Desperate Survivors Building Hope

The original 4-8 crew from the base game become the Founders. Every decision about base layout, resource allocation, and interpersonal dynamics carries forward. This is the "Oregon Trail on Mars" phase—pure survival with the first glimmers of permanence.

**Key Events:**
- First birth on Mars (massive morale event, difficult medical challenge)
- First death and burial (establishing traditions)
- First supply ship from Earth (relief, dependency)
- First locally-grown meal (celebration)
- Contact with Earth starts feeling delayed, distant

**Win Condition:** Survive 5 years with minimum 6 colonists

---

### Act 2: The Settlement (Years 6-20)
**Core Fantasy:** Frontier Town Mayor

Population grows through births and immigration waves. The base becomes a village. Specialization emerges—not everyone can do everything anymore. Politics begin as different factions form around resource allocation and cultural identity.

**Key Events:**
- First generation of Mars-born children reach adulthood
- Immigration wave from Earth (culture clash)
- First democratic election (or power consolidation)
- First serious political crisis
- First local industry (not just survival, but production)
- Earth starts treating you as a partner, not a mission

**Win Condition:** Reach 100 colonists, establish self-sustaining food production

---

### Act 3: The Colony (Years 21-50)
**Core Fantasy:** City Planner / Civilization Builder

The village becomes a town. Mars-born colonists outnumber Earth-born. A distinct Martian identity emerges. Economic systems mature. The question shifts from "will we survive?" to "what kind of society are we building?"

**Key Events:**
- Founders begin dying of old age
- Mars-born colonists take leadership positions
- First Mars-born scientists make original discoveries
- Major infrastructure projects (dome construction, terraforming begins?)
- Political independence movement (or integration debate)
- First purely Martian traditions, holidays, art

**Win Condition:** Reach 500 colonists, achieve political self-determination

---

### Act 4: The Independence (Years 51-100)
**Core Fantasy:** Nation Builder

The colony can survive without Earth. The question becomes: should it? Political factions advocate for independence, continued partnership, or even return migration. The Founders are legends (or cautionary tales). Their grandchildren inherit their legacy.

**Key Events:**
- Last Founder dies
- First crisis Earth cannot help with (too far, too slow)
- Independence declaration (or rejection)
- Second-generation Mars-born reach adulthood (never knew Earth)
- Colony-wide existential decision (expansion, terraforming, isolation?)

**Win Condition:** Player choice determines ending—multiple victory states

---

## Core Systems

### 1. Population System

#### Demographics

Every colonist is a full simulation:
- **Age:** Affects capability, fertility, mortality
- **Generation:** Earth-born, First Generation Mars-born, Second Generation+
- **Health:** Physical condition, genetic factors, accumulated radiation
- **Skills:** Primary specialty, secondary skills, learning capacity
- **Relationships:** Family ties, friendships, rivalries, romantic partners
- **Beliefs:** Political alignment, cultural values, religious views
- **Traits:** Inherited and acquired characteristics

#### Life Cycle

```
BIRTH
  ↓
CHILDHOOD (0-12)
- Education determines future skills
- Family environment shapes traits
- Childhood events create personality
  ↓
ADOLESCENCE (13-17)
- Skill specialization begins
- Peer relationships form
- Identity crisis events possible
  ↓
ADULTHOOD (18-60)
- Full productivity
- Family formation
- Leadership potential
- Accumulated trauma/experience
  ↓
ELDER (61+)
- Reduced physical capability
- Wisdom bonuses (teaching, leadership)
- Legacy concerns
- Mortality
  ↓
DEATH
- Natural causes, accident, illness
- Funeral events (culture-building)
- Inheritance (skills, possessions, relationships)
- Memory (legend or forgotten)
```

#### Reproduction

**Fertility Factors:**
- Age (peak 20-35)
- Health (radiation exposure reduces fertility)
- Nutrition (malnutrition prevents conception)
- Stress (high stress reduces fertility)
- Medical facilities (advanced care increases success)
- Genetic diversity (small population = genetic risks)

**Birth Events:**
- Pregnancy announcement (morale boost)
- Pregnancy complications (medical challenge)
- Birth (major event, community celebration)
- Naming ceremony (cultural moment)
- Childhood milestones

**The Demographic Crisis:**
If birth rate falls below replacement, the colony enters demographic crisis. This creates tension between:
- Immigration from Earth (dilutes Martian identity)
- Incentive programs (resource cost)
- Genetic intervention (ethical questions)
- Accepting decline (graceful ending?)

---

### 2. Education & Skill System

#### School System

**Early Education (Ages 6-12):**
- Basic literacy, math, Mars survival
- All children attend (unless crisis)
- Quality affects future learning capacity

**Secondary Education (Ages 13-17):**
- Specialization tracks:
  - **Technical:** Engineering, maintenance, construction
  - **Scientific:** Research, medicine, geology
  - **Agricultural:** Farming, hydroponics, ecology
  - **Administrative:** Leadership, logistics, communication
  - **Arts:** Culture, history, morale support

**Adult Education:**
- Cross-training programs
- Skill refresher courses
- Leadership development
- Earth-knowledge preservation

#### Knowledge Preservation

**The Library Problem:**
Earth holds 10,000 years of human knowledge. The colony cannot bring it all. What do you preserve?

**Priority Categories:**
- **Survival:** Engineering, medicine, agriculture (essential)
- **Science:** Research methods, fundamental knowledge (important)
- **Culture:** History, art, philosophy (luxury or essential?)
- **Entertainment:** Stories, games, music (morale necessity)

**The Forgetting:**
- Without active preservation, skills fade
- If no one practices a skill for 10 years, it becomes "archival"
- Archival skills take 2x longer to relearn
- Some Earth knowledge becomes "lost" (dramatic events)

## Implementation Notes

### Save System

Colony saves must handle:
- Full population data (hundreds of colonists)
- Multi-generational family trees
- Infrastructure state
- Resource stockpiles
- Political state
- Cultural development
- Historical events
- Relationship networks

**Compression strategy:**
- Archive old events (keep summaries)
- Dead colonists summarized after X years
- Chunk-based saving for large colonies

### Performance Considerations

**Population Simulation:**
- Tick-based, not real-time per colonist
- Aggregate where possible (disease spread, morale)
- Detail on demand (individual colonist pages)
- Background processing for long-term trends

**Event Generation:**
- Pre-calculate probability pools
- Event cooldowns prevent spam
- Priority queue for important events

### Mod Support (Dream Feature)

If implementing mod support:
- Custom events (JSON/GDScript)
- Custom buildings
- Custom research trees
- Custom political systems
- Total conversion potential

## Why This Wins Game of the Year

### Emotional Core

**The question isn't "will I survive?" but "what am I building?"**

Every colonist is someone's child, someone's parent, someone's friend. When the plague hits Year 32, you're not managing statistics—you're watching families you've known for three generations struggle. When the Founders die, it's not a resource loss—it's the end of an era you lived through.

### Mechanical Depth

**Systems that create stories:**
- The water engineer who became governor because she was the only one who understood the crisis
- The forbidden romance between the Earther delegate's daughter and the Martian independence leader's son
- The scientist who discovered the cure using techniques taught by her grandmother, the last of the original crew

### Replayability

**Every colony is different:**
- Different starting crew creates different founder culture
- Political paths diverge based on early decisions
- Tech tree specialization locks out alternatives
- Random events create unique history
- No two playthroughs tell the same story

### The GOTY Moment

The game isn't won when you hit the victory screen.

It's won when you scroll through the timeline and see:

> Year 1: Commander Chen establishes New Ares colony. 8 colonists.
> Year 7: First Martian birth: Sarah Chen-Rodriguez. Colony population: 23.
> Year 15: Commander Chen dies. Colony mourns founder. Population: 67.
> Year 23: Sarah Chen-Rodriguez elected first Mars-born Council Chair.
> Year 31: Great Dust Storm. 14 colonists lost. Sarah leads recovery.
> Year 42: Sarah Chen-Rodriguez Memorial Hospital opened.
> Year 47: Independence Vote passes 73-27.
> Year 50: The grandchildren of the Founders plant the flag of Mars.
> Year 100: Population reaches 1,000. Humanity's second home is secure.

And you realize you didn't just play a game.

You watched a civilization be born.

*"In a hundred years, they won't remember the names of presidents or celebrities. They'll remember us. The first. The founders. The ones who dared to make a home where home was impossible."*

— Final log entry, Commander Sarah Chen, Sol 1,847
