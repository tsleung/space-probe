## Game Inspirations

### EU4 (Europa Universalis 4)

**What It Does Well:**
- Grand strategy with long-term consequences that unfold over centuries
- Diplomatic relationships and faction management with complex alliance webs
- Emergent narratives that arise naturally from mechanics interacting
- No single "right" way to play - multiple viable strategies

**What We Take:**
- **Faction System:** Multiple stakeholders (NASA, Congress, Private Space) with competing interests
- **Diplomatic Actions:** Trade-offs where pleasing one faction may anger another
- **Standing Consequences:** High/low reputation unlocks different options and events
- **Long Arc Decisions:** Choices in Phase 1 ripple through Phase 4

### Tropico

**What It Does Well:**
- Colony management with multiple factions to simultaneously satisfy
- Resource balancing and production chains that create interesting logistics puzzles
- Leader personality affecting everything - El Presidente has a character
- Humor and charm in presentation without undermining stakes

**What We Take:**
- **Multiple Faction Satisfaction:** Can't please everyone, must prioritize
- **Commander Profile:** Your decisions shape who you are as a leader (Authoritarian, Democratic, Scientific, Pragmatic)

- **Tone Balance:** Serious stakes with moments of levity

---

### SimTower

**What It Does Well:**
- Vertical building with interconnected systems
- Watching your creation come alive with simulated inhabitants

- Clear cause-and-effect between infrastructure and outcomes

**What We Take:**
- **Vertical Mars Base:** Build underground for radiation protection, surface for solar
- **Power/Life Support Grids:** Interconnected systems that can cascade fail

### Oregon Trail (Core Inspiration)

**What It Does Well:**
- Meaningful preparation phase where choices matter
- Random events with player agency (not just outcomes, but choices)
- Permanent consequences - death is real, resources don't respawn

- Replayability through randomness - each playthrough feels different

**What We Take:**
- **Foundation DNA:** This is the structural core of all four phases
- **Preparation Investment:** Ship building determines travel outcomes
- **Event Agency:** Events present choices, not just results

**What We Take:**
- **Attachment-Before-Death Design:** Build investment before putting characters at risk
- **Base Pressure:** Never quite enough resources, always making trade-offs
