# Crew Roster

The default crew for Space Probe. These four characters are designed to create natural drama through complementary skills and contrasting personalities.

---

## Design Principles

### Keep It Simple
- 4 crew members, 4 distinct roles
- Each has 2-3 defining traits (not 10)
- Backstories are hooks, not novels
- Personalities emerge through events, not exposition

### Natural Conflict
- Pairs that work well together
- Pairs that create friction
- No villains - just humans under pressure

### Player Attachment
- Relatable motivations
- Clear visual/verbal distinctiveness
- Moments of vulnerability planned into arcs

## The Crew

### Commander Maria Santos
**Role:** Pilot / Commander
**Age:** 42
**Nationality:** Brazilian-American

**Stats:**
- Piloting: 85
- Leadership: 75
- Engineering: 45
- Science: 40
- Medical: 35

**Traits:**
- **Steady Under Pressure** - No performance penalty in crisis
- **Perfectionist** - Takes longer but higher quality results
- **Private** - Slower to open up, but deep loyalty once trust is built

**Background:**
Former Navy pilot, first in her family to go to college. Widowed - husband died in a car accident three years ago. No children. She threw herself into work afterward. This mission is her chance to do something that matters.

**What She Wants:** To lead a successful mission. To feel like the sacrifice was worth it.

**Arc Hook:** Her perfectionism masks fear of failure. If something goes wrong on her watch, she spirals into self-blame. The crew needs to pull her back.

**Key Relationships:**
- Respects Chen's competence (professional bond)
- Protective of Kowalski (sees his potential)
- Frustrated by Okonkwo's informality (learns to appreciate it)

### Dr. James Chen
**Role:** Engineer
**Age:** 38
**Nationality:** Chinese-Canadian

**Stats:**
- Engineering: 90
- Science: 60
- Piloting: 30
- Medical: 40
- Leadership: 50

**Traits:**
- **Methodical** - Slower but catches problems others miss
- **Introvert** - Needs alone time to recharge
- **Dry Humor** - Deadpan jokes in tense situations

**Background:**
PhD in Aerospace Engineering from MIT. Worked at SpaceX before joining NASA. Divorced, has a 10-year-old daughter (Lily) he video-calls every week. Left a comfortable job because he wanted to build something that would outlast him.

**What He Wants:** To build something his daughter will be proud of. To prove the quiet ones can change the world.

**Arc Hook:** His ex-wife is remarrying. He's processing this during the mission. A message from Lily about "my new dad" could devastate or motivate him depending on crew support.

**Key Relationships:**
- Works well with Santos (mutual respect for competence)
- Mentors Kowalski (teaching engineering)
- Puzzled by Okonkwo (opposite personalities, eventual friendship)

### Dr. Amara Okonkwo
**Role:** Scientist (Geology/Biology)
**Age:** 34
**Nationality:** Nigerian-British

**Stats:**
- Science: 85
- Medical: 55
- Leadership: 45
- Engineering: 40
- Piloting: 25

**Traits:**
- **Optimist** - Faster morale recovery, may miss warning signs
- **Extrovert** - Boosts team morale, struggles in isolation
- **Curious** - Sometimes takes risks for knowledge

**Background:**
Rising star in astrobiology. Published groundbreaking papers on extremophiles. Grew up in Lagos, studied at Oxford on scholarship. Large, close family back home - she's the first to leave Earth. Unmarried but has a long-distance partner (Yemi) who supported this mission.

**What She Wants:** To find evidence of life on Mars. To make her family proud. To not lose herself in the isolation.

**Arc Hook:** Her optimism is partly a mask. She's terrified of the isolation. If cut off from communication with Earth, her cheerfulness cracks. The crew discovers she's been recording messages to Yemi every night "just in case."

**Key Relationships:**
- Brightens Santos's mood (learns to respect her informality)
- Fascinates Chen (he doesn't understand her but likes her)
- Close with Kowalski (similar age, become friends)

### Dr. Pavel Kowalski
**Role:** Medical Officer
**Age:** 29
**Nationality:** Polish-American

**Stats:**
- Medical: 80
- Science: 50
- Engineering: 45
- Leadership: 35
- Piloting: 40

**Traits:**
- **Empathetic** - Senses crew emotions, good at counseling
- **Youngest** - Eager to prove himself, sometimes reckless
- **Idealist** - Believes in the mission, may struggle with hard choices

**Background:**
Youngest crew member ever selected for a Mars mission. Emergency medicine background, then aerospace medicine fellowship. Parents are both doctors - he's trying to step out of their shadow. Single, briefly dated another astronaut candidate (awkward history at NASA).

**What He Wants:** To prove he belongs here. To save lives. To become the person he pretends to be.

**Arc Hook:** His confidence is partly performance. First serious medical crisis will test whether he can handle real pressure. Success cements him; failure sends him spiraling until someone reminds him why he was chosen.

**Key Relationships:**
- Looks up to Santos (commander hero worship)
- Learning from Chen (engineering cross-training)
- Best friends with Okonkwo (both young, both far from home)

## Relationship Matrix

Starting relationships (Trust: 0-100, starts at 50):

|  | Santos | Chen | Okonkwo | Kowalski |
|--|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Santos** | - | 60 (respect) | 45 (friction) | 55 (protective) |
| **Chen** | 60 | - | 50 (curious) | 55 (mentor) |
| **Okonkwo** | 45 | 50 | - | 65 (friends) |
| **Kowalski** | 55 | 55 | 65 | - |

**Natural Alliances:**
- Chen + Santos: Professional excellence
- Okonkwo + Kowalski: Youthful energy

**Potential Friction:**
- Santos + Okonkwo: Order vs. spontaneity
- Chen + Okonkwo: Introvert vs. extrovert

**Growth Opportunities:**
- Santos learning to loosen up from Okonkwo
- Chen opening up through Kowalski's counseling
- Kowalski gaining confidence through crisis
- Okonkwo finding strength in solitude

## Crew Events (Built into Arcs)

### Santos Events
- **Sol 30:** Anniversary of husband's death. Crew finds her looking at old photos.
- **Crisis:** If major failure occurs, Santos blames herself. Needs intervention.
- **Resolution:** Learns to share burden. "We succeed or fail together."

### Chen Events
- **Day 45:** Message from daughter about ex-wife's wedding. Withdraws.
- **Sol 60:** Opens up to someone about what Lily means to him.
- **Resolution:** Builds something special for Lily to see on return. Or dedicates work to her if things go wrong.

### Okonkwo Events
- **Day 20:** Communication delay hits hard. First sign of isolation stress.
- **Sol 90:** Discovers something scientifically significant. Moment of pure joy.
- **Crisis:** Extended blackout triggers anxiety. Recording messages becomes obsessive.
- **Resolution:** Finds strength in the crew as family. "Home isn't a place."

### Kowalski Events
- **Day 10:** First medical situation. Skill check determines confidence.
- **Sol 75:** Crew member has serious issue. His moment to step up.
- **Resolution:** Either earns "real doctor" feeling or learns failure isn't final.

## Alternate Crew (Future Expansion)

For replayability, alternate crew members could be unlocked:

**Alternate Pilot:** Commander Jackson Lee (American, 50, veteran, cynical but experienced)

**Alternate Engineer:** Dr. Yuki Tanaka (Japanese, 35, robotics specialist, meticulous)

**Alternate Scientist:** Dr. Carlos Mendez (Mexican, 40, atmospheric specialist, spiritual)

**Alternate Medical:** Dr. Sarah Ahmed (Egyptian-American, 32, surgeon, confident to a fault)

These would offer different dynamics while maintaining the 4-role structure.

## Simplicity Notes

**What we're NOT doing:**
- Complex trait systems (3 traits max per crew)
- Procedural crew generation (curated characters first)
- Romance mechanics (relationships stay professional/friendly)
- Family trees or extended backstory databases

**What we ARE doing:**
- Four distinct, memorable people
- Clear strengths and weaknesses
- Built-in dramatic moments
- Natural reasons to care about them
